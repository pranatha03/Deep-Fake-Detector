# Deep-Fake-Detector
# 🔍 Deepfake Detector – Hackathon Project

## 🧠 Project Overview

This is a smart, AI-powered Deepfake Detector web application built as part of a hackathon challenge. It detects whether an uploaded **image** or **video** is real or fake using a **pretrained deep learning model**.

- 🔍 Supports both image & video formats
- ⚡ Fast predictions via FastAPI backend
- 🖥️ Simple & clean frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
- 🧠 Uses a CNN-based or transformer-based model for deepfake classification

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User uploads an image or video.
2. File is sent to the FastAPI server.
3. The AI model processes the media and returns a prediction.
4. Frontend displays whether the input is **real or fake**.
